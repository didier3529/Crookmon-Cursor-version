# 🚀 CODEX QUICK FIX - Jest Permission Denied Solution

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

You're getting `jest: Permission denied` because executable permissions are lost when `node_modules` is committed from Windows to Unix systems.

**Quick Fix (choose one):**

```bash
# Option 1: Node.js script (recommended)
node fix-permissions.js

# Option 2: NPM script
npm run fix-permissions

# Option 3: Shell script
chmod +x setup-codex.sh && ./setup-codex.sh
```

## ✅ EXPECTED RESULT

After running the fix, you should see:
```bash
🎉 SUCCESS! All tests are working properly.
📝 You can now use: npm test, npm run test:coverage, etc.
```

Then run:
```bash
npm test
```

And get:
```
PASS __tests__/basic.test.js
PASS __tests__/core/critical-fixes.test.js

Tests:       9 passed, 9 total
Test Suites: 2 passed, 2 total
```

## 🔧 WHAT THE FIX DOES

1. **Identifies the Problem**: Jest binary lacks executable permissions on Unix systems
2. **Fixes Permissions**: Makes all `node_modules/.bin/*` files executable
3. **Tests Jest**: Verifies Jest can run correctly
4. **Runs Tests**: Confirms the entire test suite works

## 🎯 WHY THIS HAPPENS

- `node_modules` was committed from Windows (where executable bits don't exist)
- When cloned on Unix systems (like Codex), binaries lose executable permissions
- Jest binary can't execute → `Permission denied` error

## 🚀 YOU'RE ALL SET!

After running the fix, the repository has:
- ✅ **529 Jest dependencies** included
- ✅ **Executable permissions** fixed
- ✅ **9 working tests** ready to run
- ✅ **Full TypeScript support**
- ✅ **Coverage reporting** enabled

**No more network restrictions blocking your testing! 🎉**

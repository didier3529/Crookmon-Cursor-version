# ðŸš€ CODEX QUICK START - IMMEDIATE TESTING

## âœ… PROBLEM SOLVED: Network Restrictions
This repository now includes **ALL dependencies committed** so you can test without internet access!

## ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE WORKFLOW FOR CODEX

1. **Clone Repository** (you probably already did this):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/didier3529/Crookmon-Cursor-version
   cd Crookmon-Cursor-version
   ```

2. **Fix Permissions** (required for Unix systems like Codex):

   **Option A** - Node.js script (recommended):
   ```bash
   node fix-permissions.js
   ```

   **Option B** - NPM script:
   ```bash
   npm run fix-permissions
   ```

   **Option C** - Shell script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup-codex.sh
   ./setup-codex.sh
   ```

3. **Run Tests** (after setup):
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

4. **Verify Everything Works**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:coverage
   ```

## ðŸŽ‰ WHAT'S INCLUDED FOR YOU

- âœ… **Jest 29.7.0** with all dependencies (529 packages)
- âœ… **TypeScript Support** via @babel/preset-typescript
- âœ… **React Support** via @babel/preset-react
- âœ… **All Testing Infrastructure** ready to use
- âœ… **9 Passing Tests** (2 basic + 7 critical engine tests)
- âœ… **Coverage Collection** on 47+ source files

## ðŸ“‹ AVAILABLE COMMANDS

```bash
node fix-permissions.js    # Fix permissions (recommended - run this first!)
npm run fix-permissions    # Alternative permissions fix
npm test                   # Run all tests
npm run test:watch         # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage      # Run tests with coverage
npm run test:verbose       # Run tests with detailed output
node run-tests.js          # Verification script
./setup-codex.sh           # Shell script alternative
```

## ðŸ”§ WHY THIS WORKS

**Before**: Codex couldn't run tests due to network restrictions preventing `npm install`

**Issue Found**: Even with `node_modules` committed, executable permissions are lost on Unix systems

**Now**: `setup-codex.sh` fixes permissions + all dependencies included = full testing capability!

## ðŸŽ¯ EXPECTED OUTPUT

When you run `npm test`, you should see:
```
PASS __tests__/basic.test.js
PASS __tests__/core/critical-fixes.test.js

Tests:       9 passed, 9 total
Test Suites: 2 passed, 2 total
```

## ðŸš€ START DEVELOPING

Everything is ready! You can now:
- Run tests immediately
- Modify game logic
- Add new test cases
- Generate coverage reports
- Use TypeScript and React

**Happy Coding! ðŸŽ®**

# ðŸš€ CODEX QUICK START - IMMEDIATE TESTING

## âœ… PROBLEM SOLVED: Network Restrictions
This repository now includes **ALL dependencies committed** so you can test without internet access!

## ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE WORKFLOW FOR CODEX

1. **Clone Repository** (you probably already did this):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/didier3529/Crookmon-Cursor-version
   cd Crookmon-Cursor-version
   ```

2. **Run Tests IMMEDIATELY** (no npm install needed!):
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

3. **Verify Everything Works**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:coverage
   ```

## ðŸŽ‰ WHAT'S INCLUDED FOR YOU

- âœ… **Jest 29.7.0** with all dependencies (529 packages)
- âœ… **TypeScript Support** via @babel/preset-typescript
- âœ… **React Support** via @babel/preset-react
- âœ… **All Testing Infrastructure** ready to use
- âœ… **9 Passing Tests** (2 basic + 7 critical engine tests)
- âœ… **Coverage Collection** on 47+ source files

## ðŸ“‹ AVAILABLE COMMANDS

```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:watch         # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage      # Run tests with coverage
npm run test:verbose       # Run tests with detailed output
node run-tests.js          # Verification script
```

## ðŸ”§ WHY THIS WORKS

**Before**: Codex couldn't run tests due to network restrictions preventing `npm install`

**Now**: All `node_modules` committed to repository = instant testing capability!

## ðŸŽ¯ EXPECTED OUTPUT

When you run `npm test`, you should see:
```
PASS __tests__/basic.test.js
PASS __tests__/core/critical-fixes.test.js

Tests:       9 passed, 9 total
Test Suites: 2 passed, 2 total
```

## ðŸš€ START DEVELOPING

Everything is ready! You can now:
- Run tests immediately
- Modify game logic
- Add new test cases
- Generate coverage reports
- Use TypeScript and React

**Happy Coding! ðŸŽ®**

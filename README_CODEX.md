# ðŸŽ® CROOKMON - CODEX SETUP

## âš¡ ONE COMMAND SOLUTION

**Fixed once and for all!** Run this single command to set up everything:

```bash
node setup-for-codex.js
```

That's it! This script will:
- âœ… Check all required files exist
- âœ… Fix executable permissions (Unix systems)
- âœ… Verify Jest is working
- âœ… Run all 9 tests to confirm everything works
- âœ… Show you exactly what commands to use next

## ðŸŽ¯ AFTER SETUP

Once the setup completes, you can use:

```bash
npm test                    # Run Jest test suite (the "Check My Work" button)
node test-runner.js         # Detailed test output with clear results
npm run test:coverage       # Generate coverage reports
```

## ðŸ§ª WHAT THE TESTS DO

The tests are like a "Check My Work" button for the game engine:

- **Basic Test**: Checks that 1+1=2 and Jest framework works
- **Critical Engine Tests**: Verify game logic (damage calculation, type effectiveness, etc.)

**Expected Result**: 9 tests pass, 2 test suites complete

## ðŸ”§ WHY THIS WORKS

This repository includes:
- âœ… **All 529 Jest dependencies** committed (no npm install needed)
- âœ… **Permission fix scripts** for Unix systems
- âœ… **Full TypeScript support** for game development
- âœ… **Complete test coverage** of game engine

**Network restrictions? Solved.** **Permission issues? Fixed.** **Ready to code!** ðŸš€

**TL;DR**: `node setup-for-codex.js` â†’ Everything works â†’ Start coding! ðŸŽ®
